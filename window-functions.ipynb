    "# What are Window Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Window functions are a powerful feature of SQL that allow you to perform calculations across a set of table rows that are related to the current row. Window functions are similar to aggregate functions, but they do not group rows into a single output row. Instead, they return a single value for each row based on a window of rows."

    "## Why Use Window Functions?\n",

    "Window Functions are useful for a number of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Comparing Rows**: You can compare the current row with other rows in the table.\n",
    "2. **Ranking Rows**: You can assign a rank to each row based on a specific column.\n",
    "3. **Calculating Running Totals**: You can calculate running totals for a column.\n",
    "4. **Calculating Percentiles**: You can calculate percentiles for a column.\n",
    "5. **Calculating Moving Averages**: You can calculate moving averages for a column.\n",
    "6. **Calculating Differences**: You can calculate differences between rows."

    "## Use Cases for Window Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common use cases for window functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ranking**: You can rank rows based on a specific column.\n",
    "2. **Partitioning**: You can partition rows into groups based on a specific column.\n",
    "3. **Aggregating**: You can aggregate data within a window.\n",
    "4. **Filtering**: You can filter rows based on a window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a window function that calculates the running total of a column:\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    order_id,\n",
    "    order_date,\n",
    "    order_amount,\n",
    "    SUM(order_amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    orders;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It selects the `order_id`, `order_date`, and `order_amount` columns from the `orders` table.\n",
    "2. It calculates the running total of the `order_amount` column using the `SUM()` function and the `OVER` clause.\n",
    "3. It orders the rows by the `order_date` column.\n",
    "4. It assigns the running total to the `running_total` column.\n",
    "5. It returns the `order_id`, `order_date`, `order_amount`, and `running_total` columns.\n",
    "6. It returns the results in ascending order of `order_date` in a single output row for each row in the `orders` table that is the running total for each row in the `orders` table."
