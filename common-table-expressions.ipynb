They are defined using the WITH keyword and are useful for creating complex queries that are easier to read and maintain.  They are a little bit like context managers in Python, but for SQL!"

    "\n",
    "CTEs are useful for a number of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Readability**: CTEs can make complex queries easier to read and understand by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.\n",
    "2. **Reusability**: CTEs can be referenced multiple times within a query, allowing you to reuse the same logic in different parts of the query.\n",
    "3. **Performance**: CTEs can improve query performance by allowing the database engine to optimize the execution plan.\n",
    "4. **Debugging**: CTEs can be used to isolate and test specific parts of a query, making it easier to identify and fix issues.\n",
    "5. **Recursive Queries**: CTEs can be used to create recursive queries that reference themselves, allowing you to work with hierarchical data structures.\n",
    "6. **Window Functions**: CTEs can be used in conjunction with window functions to perform complex analytical queries. (Window functions are a powerful feature of SQL that allow you to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row.)\n",
    "7. **Data Transformation**: CTEs can be used to transform data in a query, such as aggregating, filtering, or joining data from multiple tables."

    "## Use Cases for CTEs\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common use cases for CTEs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recursive Queries**: CTEs can be used to create recursive queries that reference themselves, allowing you to work with hierarchical data structures such as organizational charts, bill of materials, or social networks.\n",
    "2. **Reusable Queries**: CTEs can be used to define reusable subqueries that can be referenced multiple times within a query, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.\n",
    "3. **Data Transformation**: CTEs can be used to transform data in a query, such as aggregating, filtering, or joining data from multiple tables.\n",

    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (\n",
    "    SELECT employee_id, manager_id\n",
    "    FROM employees\n",
    "    WHERE manager_id IS NULL\n",
    "    UNION ALL\n",
    "    SELECT e.employee_id, e.manager_id\n",
    "    FROM employees e\n",
    "    JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id\n",
    ")\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM employee_hierarchy;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The initial query selects the root node of the hierarchy (employees with no manager).\n",
    "- The recursive part of the query joins the employees table with the CTE to find the direct reports of each manager.\n",
    "- The UNION ALL operator combines the results of the initial query and the recursive part to generate the final result set.\n",
    "- The SELECT statement at the end retrieves the final result set.\n",

You can replace the `<NA>` values with `None` or any other value using the `fillna()` method.  Let's replace the `<NA>` values with `0` for this employee.  It is often better to keep values as `None` or `NULL` in the database.  We often remove `NULL` values from the data when we load it into a DataFrame.  However, in this case, we want to keep the `NULL` values to represent the absence of a manager and therefore, we'll convert the `<NA>` values to `0`."
