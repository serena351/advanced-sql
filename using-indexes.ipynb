    "# What are Indexes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes are a way to optimise the performance of a database by reducing the number of disk accesses required when a query is processed. They are a data structure that allows for faster retrieval of data from a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes are created on columns in a table. When you create an index on a column, the database creates a separate data structure that holds the values of that column and pointers to the rows in the table that contain those values.\n"

    "## Why Use Indexes?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you query a table using a column that has an index, the database can use the index to quickly find the rows that match the query criteria. This can significantly speed up the query execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes are particularly useful for columns that are frequently used in queries, such as columns that are used in WHERE clauses or JOIN conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes are useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Speeding up query execution\n",
    "- Reducing the number of disk accesses required to retrieve data\n",
    "- Improving the performance of frequently used queries\n",
    "- Enforcing data integrity constraints\n",
    "- Preventing duplicate values in a column\n",
    "- Enforcing uniqueness constraints\n",
    "- Supporting efficient data retrieval operations\n",
    "\n",
    "However, they should be used judiciously, as they can also have a negative impact on performance if they are not used correctly, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Slowing down data modification operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)\n",
    "- Consuming additional disk space\n",
    "- Increasing the time required to build and maintain the index\n",
    "- Reducing the performance of queries that do not use the index\n",
    "- Increasing the complexity of the database schema\n",
    "- Increasing the risk of deadlocks and other concurrency issues"

    "## Use Cases for Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common use cases for indexes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Primary Key Index***:\n",
    "  - A primary key index is used to enforce the uniqueness of the primary key column in a table. It is automatically created when you define a primary key constraint on a column.\n",
    "- ***Unique Index***:\n",
    "  - A unique index is used to enforce the uniqueness of a column or a combination of columns in a table. It is automatically created when you define a unique constraint on a column or a combination of columns.\n",
    "- ***Foreign Key Index***:\n",
    "  - A foreign key index is used to enforce referential integrity between two tables. It is automatically created when you define a foreign key constraint on a column.\n",
    "- ***Composite Index***:\n",
    "  - A composite index is used to index multiple columns in a table. It is useful when you frequently query on a combination of columns.\n",
    "- ***Clustered Index***:\n",
    "  - A clustered index is used to physically order the rows in a table based on the values of the indexed column. It is useful when you frequently query on the indexed column.\n",
    "- ***Non-Clustered Index***:\n",
    "  - A non-clustered index is used to create a separate data structure that holds the values of the indexed column and pointers to the rows in the table. It is useful when you frequently query on the indexed column but do not need to physically order the rows in the table.\n",
    "- ***Covering Index***:\n",
    "  - A covering index is used to include all the columns required by a query in the index itself. It is useful when you frequently query on a combination of columns and need to retrieve all the columns in the query result."

    "\n",
    "The query with indexes performed better because the database could use the index on `employee_id` to quickly locate the row that matched the query criteria. This is known as an **index seek** operation, where the database can directly access the row using the index without scanning the entire table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the query without indexes had to perform a **full table scan**, which involves reading every row in the table to find the matching row. This is a time-consuming operation, especially for large tables, as it requires reading and processing a large amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating an index on the `employee_id` column, we provided the database with a more efficient way to locate the row, resulting in faster query execution and improved performance."
